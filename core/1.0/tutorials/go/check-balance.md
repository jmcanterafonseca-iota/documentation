# Check the balance of an address in Java

**In this tutorial, you request the balance of IOTA tokens on addresses from a node.**

## Packages

To complete this tutorial, you need to install the following packages (if you're using Go modules, you just need to reference them):

```bash
go get github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/api
go get github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/trinary
```

## IOTA network

In this tutorial, we connect to a node on the [Devnet](root://getting-started/1.0/networks/overview.md).

## Code walkthrough

1. Import the packages

    ```go
    package main

    import (
        . "github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/api"
        "github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/trinary"
        "fmt"
    )
    ```
2. Connect to a node

    ```go
    var node = "https://nodes.devnet.thetangle.org"
    api, err := ComposeAPI(HTTPClientSettings{URI: node})
    must(err)
    ```

3. Define the address whose balance you want to check

    ```go
    const address = trinary.Trytes("MBYBBFONQZPYZYZHSEZJ9EBEBAFHAZKUFSPBM9YOXJUUAMBUCQQABOWFNPEAGXIGMAVWWFZWDCZJGUTBBZYDSALMPA")
    ```

4. Use the [`GetBalances()`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/blob/master/.docs/iota.go/reference/api_get_balances.md) method to ask the IOTA node for the current balance of the address

    ```go
    balances, err := api.GetBalances(trinary.Hashes{address}, 100)
    must(err)
    fmt.Println("\nBalance: ", balances.Balances[0])
    ```

    In the console, you should see a balance of IOTA tokens:

    ```
    Balance: 500
    ```
